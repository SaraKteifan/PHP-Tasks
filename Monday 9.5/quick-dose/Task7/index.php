// 7-In this PHP exercise, you will create an array of temperatures. Choose a spring month to have a wider range of temperatures to handle. We'll use 30 days of the month. The exercise is generic, but feel free to use a specific month in your own script. The answer script will use the Fahrenheit scale, but again feel free to use Celsius if you prefer.

// Create your array of 30 high temperatures, approximating the weather for a spring month, then find the average high temp, the five warmest high temps and the five coolest high temps. Print your findings to the browser.

// Hint: the HTML character entity for the degree sign is &deg;.

// Feel free to make up the temps or gather data for your own area. Here's a list of thirty Fahrenheit high temperatures you can use if you like:
// 68, 70, 72, 58, 60, 79, 82, 73, 75, 77, 73, 58, 63, 79, 78,
// 68, 72, 73, 80, 79, 68, 72, 75, 77, 73, 78, 82, 85, 89, 83
